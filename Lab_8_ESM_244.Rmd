###Column graph of Texas oil spills

```{r}


oil_spills <- read_csv("oil_spills.csv")

df <- oil_spills %>% 
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` < 2017) %>% 
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>% 
  summarise(Loss = sum(`Net Loss (Barrels)`))

 #if you ever fail to change the column headings to R friendly names you just have to add these '' to surround column headings (under squiggly tilde on keyboard, uppermost left key)

# we want to calculate the net loss of oil in Texas by year so we need to group by year

# now the df data frame is a super simplified data set with just the year and the net loss of oil from that year

colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

#renamed column headings for simplified data set 

ggplot(df, aes(x= Year, y= Loss)) +
  geom_col()

#create a column graph of this simple data set 

```
